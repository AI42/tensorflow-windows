Changes since the last public release (1.2.52):

  Issue a png_error() instead of a png_warning() when width is
    potentially too large for the architecture, in case the calling
    application has overridden the default 1,000,000-column limit
    (fixes CVE-2014-9495 and CVE-2015-0973).
  Quieted some harmless warnings from Coverity-scan.
  Display user limits in the output from pngtest.
  Changed PNG_USER_CHUNK_MALLOC_MAX from unlimited to 8,000,000.
    This can only be changed at library-build time.  It only
    affects the maximum memory that can be allocated to an
    ancillary chunk; it does not limit the size of IDAT
    data, which is instead limited by PNG_USER_WIDTH_MAX.
  Rebuilt configure scripts with automake-1.15 and libtool-2.4.6
